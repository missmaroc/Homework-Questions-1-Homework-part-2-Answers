    <p>Graphic design uses visual compositions to solve problems and communicate ideas through typography, imagery, color and form. There’s no one way to do that, and that’s why there are several types of graphic design, each with their own area of specialization. Though they often overlap, each type of graphic design requires specific set of skills and design techniques.</p>
