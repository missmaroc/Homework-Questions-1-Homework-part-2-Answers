    1- The HTML5 specification introduced several semantic sectioning elements to help organize the structure of documents.
    2- Semantic sectioning elements are specifically designed to communicate structural meaning to browsers and other technologies interpreting the document on behalf of users, such as screen readers and voice assistants.
    3- Semantic sectioning elements clarify the larger-scale structures within a document. They are intended to enhance the limited semantics of earlier versions of HTML, which included only the div element as a generic mechanism for grouping related content.Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: <form> , <table> , and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
    4- 
    5- nav element, article element, section element and aside element.
    6- nav element defines a section that contains navigation links that usually appear on a site. There can be primary and secondary menus, but a nav element cannot be nested inside another nav element. <nav>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
   <li><a href="/events">Current Events</a></li>
    <script src=""></script>
    7- Article element defines a piece of self-contained content. It does not only refer to the main content, and can be used for comments and widgets as well, which could theoretically be distributed to other websites and platforms as a stand-alone unit. 
    <article is="stock-widget">
    <h1>Stocks</h1>
    <table>
    <thead> <tr> <th> Stock <th> Value <th> Delta
    <tbody> <template> <tr> <td> <td> <td> </template>
    </table>  
 <p> <input type=button value="Refresh" onclick="this.parentElement.refresh()">
  </article>
<article is="news-widget">
