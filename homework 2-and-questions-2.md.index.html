<body>
   1. CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheets”. <p>
   2. Cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. body {color: green;}. <p>
   3. The purpose of CSS is to provide Web developers with a standard way to define, apply, and manage sets of style characteristics. <p>
   4. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.<p>
   5. A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.<p>
   6.  CSS selectors are defined by first indicating the name of the CSS selector, followed by an opening { and closing } curly brace.<p>
   7. A CSS property styles an aspect of an HTML element, the color property will style the color of the element, for example  {color: red;} The name of the property above is color, and its value is red. This means that the color of all a elements on the HTML page will be red.<p>
   8. A property declaration consists of a property name and its corresponding value. A property declaration should always end with a ; semi-colon.<p>
   9. A rule set is a single section of CSS including the selector, the curly braces, and lines containing property declarations (properties and their values). a { color: blue;text-decoration: none;} <p>
   10. DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. The main idea with DRY in CSS is to avoid repeating the same bits of code in our style sheet.<p>
   11. A CSS declaration block is the section of CSS which contains the property names and their values. In other words, they are the lines which appear between the opening { and closing } curly braces.<p>
   12. An element type selector is a selector which targets an element by its element name. section { background: green;} <p>
   13. The class selector targets an element by its class name. Every element with the same class name will receive the styles set in the property declarations of the particular rule set in question. .para {font-size: 2 rem; font-family: font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}. <p>
   14. One can also specify that only specific element(s) should be specified by a class. p.center {text-align: center;}
   This way, if an p element also contains the .center class. For example, only the p element with the .center class will be affected.<p>
   15. The id selector targets an element by its id. The element with a certain unique id will receive the styles set in the property declarations of the particular rule set in question. #main-header {text-align: center;} <p>
   16. The universal selector represented by * (asterisk) targets all HTML elements on the page, and all the elements receive the styling set by the property declarations within the universal selector rule set's declaration block. 
   * { margin: 0; padding: 0;box-sizing: border-box;} <p>
   17. The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions. h1, p { text-align: center;} <p>
   18. An attribute selector selects an element to target based on an HTML attribute name and/or its value.input[name] 
   {color: blue;} <p>
   19. CSS selectors can be separated into 5 categories:<p>
       - Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, or class)<p>
       - Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)<p>
       - Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)<p>
       - Pseudo-element selectors (select and style a part of an element)<p>
       - Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute name and/or attribute value)<p>
   20. So far, we have gone over all the simple selectors:<p>
       - The element type selector<p>
       - The class selector<p>
       - The id selector<p>
       - Selecting specific elements by class (or id) <p>
       - The universal selector<p>
       - The grouping selector <p>
    We also briefly covered the attribute selector category, because we touched upon the element attribute when covering basic HTML.
