 <h1>Homework Questions 1 (Homework part 2) Answers</h1> 
    <p>
    <p>
    1. Html stands for Hypertext Markup Language.<p>
    2. HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages.<p>
    3. An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document. It represents semantics, or meaning and it defines the structure and content of an object within a web page. For example, the title element represents the title of the document.<p>
    4. An HTML element is identified by the use of < and > angle brackets, which surround the element name. An HTML element usually consists of an opening and closing tag, and in between the tags is the `element content. <p>
    5. An HTML tag can either be the opening or closing tag of an HTML element. There are also self-closing tags, when an element only consists of one tag. <p>
    6. HTML element is the collection of start tag, its attributes, an end tag and everything in between. On the other hand an HTML tag (either opening or closing) is used to mark the start or end of an element. <p>
    7. HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. HTML attributes generally appear as name-value pairs, separated by =, and are written within the start tag of an element."  <p>
    8. The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document. The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. <p>
    9. Global attribute, the global attributes are attributes that can be used with all HTML elements. <p>
    10. Class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. <p>
    11. The class attribute is a global attribute which can be used in any HTML element. The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. <p>
    12. An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. The HTML element usually consists of an opening and closing tag, and in between the tags is the element content. <header><h1>This is an example!</h1>
    13. DOCTYPE html is the first line of code required in every HTML. The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers. A document type declaration.<p>
    14. The html element is root or a base where all other elements are descendants of and the attribute is a global lang attribute.<p>
    15. The head elements collectively describes the properties of the document such as title, provide meta information like character set, instruct the browser where to find the style sheets or scripts that allows you to extend the HTML document.<p>
    16. The first element inside a basic web page's head  element is a meta element with the charset attribute. The charset attribute is one of the attributes that the meta element accepts. it is NOT a global element. The meta element defines metadata about an html document. Metadata is data (information) about data. The meta element's charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. <p>
    17. UTF-8 stands for "Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bits‚Äù. <p>
    18. Encoding is the process of taking characters for human languge and turning them into binary seqences. <p>
    19. If one uses anything other than the most basic English text on a web page, users may not be able to read the content unless some sort of character encoding is specified. Not specifying some sort of character encoding could also mean that the data on the page might not be found by search engines, or reliably processed by machines.<p>
    20. Unicode is an encoding system that solved the space issue that its predecessor ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a character encoding standard). Just as ASCII before it, Unicode assigns a unique code, called a code point, to each character. Unlike ASCII, Unicode is able to produce over a million code points, more than enough to account for every character in any language. Unicode is now the universal standard for encoding all human languages. It even includes emojis.<p>
    21. Unicode can't be a standalone when it comes to encoding characters because it does not store characters in binary. And computers need a way to translate Unicode into binary so that its characters can be stored in text files.<p>
    22. UTF-8 is an encoding system for Unicode. It can translate any Unicode character to a matching unique binary string, and can also translate the binary string back to a Unicode character.<p>
    23. UTF-8 is unique because it represents characters as one-byte that consits of 8-bits. <p>
    24. UTF-8 advantages is that by represents characters as one-byte that consits of 8-bits it saves space for information it create code points and lastly it's backwards compatible with ascii. <p>
    25. It defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab. <p>
    26. The body element is the container for all renderable aspects of a document. This is the place where authors throw all the elements and contents their visitors will reach. The body element is part of the basic structure of a document. The body element had several presentational attributes in previous versions of HTML. <p>
    27. The h1 element's contents should describe the overall purpose of the page content. If the content of the h1 element does successfully describe the overall purpose of the page content, it will improve the SEO of the web page, thereby improving its ranking in search results. <p>
    28. the p element represents a paragraph of text. Heading elements (i.e., h1 element) are often followed by supporting p elements. Paragraphs are usually represented as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but they can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.<p>
    29. UTF-8 is the default character encoding for HTML5. <p>
    30. The viewport is the user's visible area of the WEB PAGE. The viewport varies with different devices, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. Before tablets and mobile phones came along, web pages were only designed for computer screens, and web page layouts were static only had one size. When mobile phones and tablets were introduced, static sites were too large to fit the viewport of the mobile phone or tablet, for example. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page` to fit the screen. This was not a perfect solution, only a quick fix. HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport through the meta element.
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">. This meta viewport tag should be added to the head of the HTML document. It gives the browsers instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
    The meta element's name attribute's value is "viewport", which indicates the kind of meta element. The "width=device-width" part of the meta element's content attribute value sets the width of the page to follow the screen width of the device, which will vary depending on the device. The "initial-scale=1.0" part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
